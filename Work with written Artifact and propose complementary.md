Given the following artifact (e.g., a document, plan, report, or other written content):

Artifact: [Insert the full text or description of the artifact here.]

Analyze the artifact to identify its core themes, strengths, gaps, and potential extensions. Then, propose at least four complementary analyses, reports, or artifacts that enhance or build upon the original. Each proposal should be distinct in focus (e.g., one on strategic evaluation, one on operational feasibility, one on stakeholder impact, one on future projections) and explain how it complements the original by addressing underserved aspects or providing deeper insights. For each complementary item:

- **Title and Type**: Suggest a clear title and categorize it (e.g., "SWOT Analysis Report" as a strategic evaluation).
- **Purpose and Complementarity:** Briefly describe its objective and why it pairs well with the original artifact (e.g., filling a gap in risk assessment).
- **Key Sections or Outline**: Provide a high-level structure, including 3-5 main sections or components.
- **Benefits**: Highlight 2-3 advantages of creating this complementary piece.
- **Effort Estimate:** Give a rough estimate of the time or resources needed to produce it (e.g., low/medium/high effort).


Ensure the proposals are feasible, diverse, and tailored to the artifact's context (e.g., business, technical, creative). Synthesize the options by recommending a prioritized sequence for developing them, based on factors like urgency, impact, or dependencies, but note that the final choice depends on the user's goals and resources. Present the response in a structured format with sections for verification, analysis summary, each proposal, and final synthesis.
