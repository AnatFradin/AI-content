# Best Practices

# Next.js Best Practices

- **File Organization** - Use a clear file structure with `/components`, `/pages`, `/lib`, `/styles`, and `/public` directories for better organization.
- **Routing** - Use Next.js App Router for routing, with dynamic routes for listings (e.g., `/listings/[id]`) and static routes for static pages (e.g., `/about`).
- **Performance** - Optimize performance by lazy-loading images, using Next.js Image component, and minimizing re-renders.
- **SEO** - Use Next.js built-in SEO features, such as `next/head`, to improve search engine visibility.
- **Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling for API routes and frontend components.

# TypeScript Best Practices

- **Type Safety** - Use TypeScript for better type safety and catching potential errors early.
- **Interfaces** - Define interfaces for props, state, and API responses to ensure type safety.
- **Strict Mode** - Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` to catch more errors.
- **Avoid Any** - Avoid using the `any` type to ensure type safety.
- **Type Inference** - Leverage TypeScript's type inference to reduce boilerplate code.

# React Best Practices

- **Component Structure** - Build reusable components to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.
- **State Management** - Use React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer) for simple state management, and Zustand for complex state management.
- **Performance** - Optimize performance by using React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Accessibility** - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast.
- **Testing** - Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.

# General Best Practices

- **Code Consistency** - Enforce code consistency using ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting.
- **Version Control** - Use Git for version control, with clear commit messages and branching strategies.
- **Documentation** - Document the codebase and update the knowledge base regularly.
- **Security** - Follow security best practices, such as using environment variables for sensitive data and securing API routes.
- **Performance** - Optimize performance by lazy-loading images, minimizing re-renders, and using efficient data fetching.
