# Project Overview

At Code Product hunt is a web-based marketplace where no-code developers and Indie hackers can list their startups for sale, like name, website, industry, revenue, user base, and single-while allowing buyers to explore listings using conversations and negotiations about potential transactions. The integration of user authentication via Clerk ensures a secure and streamlined user login process for both parties.

This project is being built to improve order-developers by providing them with a dedicated space to value, showcase, and sell their startups to interested buyers. The platform will be measured by user engagement, the number of successful exchanges initiated through the chat and the overall user satisfaction with the clear and minimalistic design.
